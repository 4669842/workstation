Chef questions / notes.

1. config.rb file for chef-solo is unable to detect errors in names like
     json_attrs = root + "/config-solo.json"
   or
     json_attrs root + "/config-solo.json"  
   instead of
     json_attribs root + "/config-solo.json"
   
2. how to access current cookbook path for externally maintained books?

3. while writing a chef-solo recipe, where to see values for accessible attributes?
