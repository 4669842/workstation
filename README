Here are various scenarios how to get workstation
box operational as soon as possible.

= Workstation

..is a systems with personal tools required to do
the job. Mine are::

  (browser: all firefox, google-chrome)
  git
  hg
  vim

== Workstation in Fedora 17

  git
  hg
  vim

  google-chrome

= Bootstraping workstation
== ..With Chef on Linux

Bootstrap Chef (tested: Fedora 17):
  sudo yum install rubygems ruby-devel gcc
  sudo gem install chef --no-ri --no-rdoc

Use chef-solo for bootstrapping. For the intro see
http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo


chef-solo can be run with local recipe when offline
or using configuration directly from GitHub
(TODO: check).

Locally (from this directory):
  sudo `which chef-solo` -c chef/config-solo.rb

  NOTE: `which` is required, because by default
        chef-solo is not in PATH for root on Fedora
